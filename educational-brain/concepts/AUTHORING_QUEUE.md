# Authoring Queue — Permanent Order

Computed purely from the prerequisite graph — no manual ordering. Every
concept already `READY` (has an Educational Brain entry) is excluded from
this queue; everything else is ordered by two rules only:

1. **Dependency level** (topological depth from that subject's root(s),
   computed by Kahn's algorithm over the `requires` DAG): a concept can
   never appear before every one of its prerequisites.
2. **Subject interleaving**: at each dependency level, subjects are
   processed in a fixed order — mathematics, physics, english, chemistry,
   biology, computer_science (the order `COVERAGE.md`'s table already
   uses) — rather than fully draining one subject before starting the
   next. This directly implements Phase 4's "find unfinished root
   concepts; if none remain, unlock the next dependency layer" rule at
   global scale, and generalizes `ROADMAP.md`'s prior recommendation
   (entry points across all subjects before going deep in any one).
3. **Within the same subject and level**: KG file order (the order
   concepts already appear in that subject's `graph.json`, itself
   authored in roughly domain/prerequisite order by the Curriculum
   Production Pipeline) — the one remaining tie-break, deterministic and
   reproducible, not a preference.

Total queued: **1524** (= 1,775 KG concepts − 251 already `READY`).

**Domain Certification Mode override (binding until `math.found` reaches
82/82, EXPLICITLY SUSPENDED for physics-specific batches by direct user
instruction — see note below)**: the global graph-derived order below is
otherwise superseded at the top by the standing single-domain constraint
— `math.found`'s own 51 remaining concepts (Wave 6 onward) must be
authored to completion before any other subject or domain is started,
regardless of where those 51 concepts fall in the global order shown
here. Wave 6 (5 concepts, level 6 — prerequisites satisfied by Wave 5):
`math.found.logical-equivalence`, `math.found.ordinal-number`,
`math.found.quantifiers`, `math.found.relation`, `math.found.subset`. See
`ROADMAP.md` §3/§5 for the authoritative domain-status tracker; this
file's row order remains the correct reference for cross-domain priority
ONLY once `math.found` is complete and certified.

**Physics Wave 6 exception (2026-07-22)**: a direct, explicit user
instruction ("continue authoring the remaining Educational Brain
concepts [for physics] in strict prerequisite/topological order")
directed work specifically at the physics subject for this batch,
overriding the math.found-first default above for this one batch only.
`math.found` was NOT touched (still 31/82, still IN PROGRESS) and remains
the standing default priority for any future batch that is not given an
equally explicit subject-specific instruction. This batch authored all
12 physics concepts at dependency level 6 (the full level, not a partial
slice) — `phys.mech.universal-gravitation`, `phys.mech.hookes-law`,
`phys.mech.pressure-fluids`, `phys.wave.standing-waves`, `phys.wave.beats`,
`phys.opt.optical-instruments`, `phys.opt.youngs-experiment`,
`phys.em.capacitance`, `phys.em.ohms-law`, `phys.em.amperes-law`,
`phys.em.lenzs-law`, `phys.em.self-inductance` — verified programmatically
against the live physics KG's `requires` edges (all had every prerequisite
already `READY`), removed from the rows below, and priority numbers
renumbered accordingly (1673 → 1661 remaining).

**Physics Wave 7 (2026-07-23)**: continuing the same explicit physics-specific
override (mandatory rules issued directly for continued Physics Educational
Brain production), authored all 25 physics concepts at dependency level 7
(the full level, not a partial slice) — `phys.mech.friction`,
`phys.mech.tension`, `phys.mech.normal-force`, `phys.mech.kinetic-energy`,
`phys.mech.potential-energy`, `phys.mech.power`, `phys.mech.impulse`,
`phys.mech.center-of-mass`, `phys.mech.angular-kinematics`,
`phys.mech.gravitational-field`, `phys.mech.stress-strain`,
`phys.mech.buoyancy`, `phys.mech.surface-tension`, `phys.therm.first-law`,
`phys.wave.shm`, `phys.opt.diffraction`, `phys.em.dielectrics`,
`phys.em.energy-capacitor`, `phys.em.resistivity`, `phys.em.dc-circuits`,
`phys.em.electrical-power`, `phys.em.solenoid`, `phys.em.mutual-inductance`,
`phys.em.ac-basics`, `phys.em.maxwells-equations` — verified programmatically
against the live physics KG's `requires` edges via an independent Kahn's-
algorithm recomputation (matched the stored level-7 row set exactly, zero
discrepancy), removed from the rows below, and priority numbers renumbered
accordingly (1661 → 1636 remaining). `math.found` remains untouched at
31/82 per the standing default. Physics EB now 104/238 (79 existing + 25
this wave); next unlocked wave is dependency level 8 (15 concepts).

**Physics Wave 8 (2026-07-23)**: continuing the same mandatory-rules
production cycle, authored all 15 physics concepts at dependency level 8
(the full level, not a partial slice) — `phys.mech.inclined-plane`,

`phys.mech.conservation-of-momentum`, `phys.mech.torque`,
`phys.mech.gravitational-potential`, `phys.therm.thermodynamic-processes`,
`phys.wave.shm-energy`, `phys.wave.pendulum`, `phys.wave.spring-mass`,
`phys.opt.single-slit`, `phys.em.kirchhoffs-laws`, `phys.em.emf`,
`phys.em.lc-circuits`, `phys.em.electromagnetic-waves` — verified
programmatically against the live physics KG's `requires` edges via an
independent Kahn's-algorithm recomputation (matched the stored level-8
row set exactly, zero discrepancy), removed from the rows below, and
priority numbers renumbered accordingly (1636 → 1621 remaining).
`math.found` remains untouched at 31/82. Physics EB now 119/238 (104
existing + 15 this wave); next unlocked wave is dependency level 9 (16
concepts).

**Physics Wave 9 (2026-07-23)**: continuing the same mandatory-rules
production cycle, authored all 16 physics concepts at dependency level 9
(the full level, not a partial slice) — `phys.mech.conservative-forces`,
`phys.mech.collisions-elastic`, `phys.mech.collisions-inelastic`,
`phys.mech.moment-of-inertia`, `phys.mech.equilibrium`,
`phys.mech.orbital-mechanics`, `phys.mech.escape-velocity`,
`phys.mech.bernoulli`, `phys.therm.second-law`, `phys.therm.heat-engines`,
`phys.wave.damped-oscillations`, `phys.em.wheatstone-bridge`,
`phys.em.potentiometer`, `phys.em.rc-circuits`,
`phys.mod.photoelectric-effect`, `phys.rel.postulates` — verified
programmatically against the live physics KG's `requires` edges via an
independent Kahn's-algorithm recomputation (matched the stored level-9
row set exactly, zero discrepancy), removed from the rows below, and
priority numbers renumbered accordingly (1621 → 1605 remaining).
`math.found` remains untouched at 31/82. Physics EB now 135/238 (119
existing + 16 this wave); next unlocked wave is dependency level 10 (9
concepts). This wave included the entry points into two new physics
domains for this program: Modern Physics
(`phys.mod.photoelectric-effect`) and Relativity (`phys.rel.postulates`).

**Physics Wave 10 (2026-07-23)**: continuing the same mandatory-rules
production cycle, authored all 9 physics concepts at dependency level 10
(the full level, not a partial slice) — `phys.mech.rotational-dynamics`,
`phys.mech.keplers-laws`, `phys.mech.satellites`, `phys.mech.viscosity`,
`phys.mech.generalized-coordinates`, `phys.therm.entropy`,
`phys.wave.forced-oscillations`, `phys.mod.photons`,
`phys.rel.simultaneity` — verified programmatically against the live
physics KG's `requires` edges via an independent Kahn's-algorithm
recomputation (matched the stored level-10 row set exactly, zero
discrepancy), removed from the rows below, and priority numbers
renumbered accordingly (1605 → 1596 remaining). `math.found` remains
untouched at 31/82. Physics EB now 144/238 (135 existing + 9 this wave);
next unlocked wave is dependency level 11 (11 concepts).

**Physics Wave 11 (2026-07-23)**: continuing the same mandatory-rules
production cycle, authored all 11 physics concepts at dependency level 11
(the full level, not a partial slice) — `phys.mech.angular-momentum`,
`phys.mech.rolling-motion`, `phys.mech.euler-lagrange-equation`,
`phys.therm.carnot-cycle`, `phys.therm.third-law`,
`phys.mod.compton-effect`, `phys.mod.de-broglie`, `phys.mod.bohr-model`,
`phys.mod.x-rays`, `phys.rel.time-dilation`,
`phys.stat.probability-basics` — verified programmatically against the
live physics KG's `requires` edges via an independent Kahn's-algorithm
recomputation (matched the stored level-11 row set exactly, zero
discrepancy), removed from the rows below, and priority numbers
renumbered accordingly (1596 → 1585 remaining). `math.found` remains
untouched at 31/82. Physics EB now 155/238 (144 existing + 11 this
wave); next unlocked wave is dependency level 12 (8 concepts). This
wave included the first Statistical Mechanics domain entry for this
program (`phys.stat.probability-basics`).

**Physics Wave 12 (2026-07-23)**: continuing the same mandatory-rules
production cycle, authored all 8 physics concepts at dependency level 12
(the full level, not a partial slice) — `phys.mech.conservation-of-angular-momentum`,
`phys.mech.cyclic-coordinates-conservation-laws`, `phys.mech.hamiltonian`,
`phys.therm.refrigerators`, `phys.mod.wave-particle-duality`,
`phys.mod.atomic-spectra`, `phys.rel.length-contraction`,
`phys.stat.boltzmann-factor` — verified programmatically against the live
physics KG's `requires` edges via an independent Kahn's-algorithm
recomputation (matched the stored level-12 row set exactly, zero
discrepancy), removed from the rows below, and priority numbers
renumbered accordingly (1585 → 1577 remaining). `math.found` remains
untouched at 31/82. Physics EB now 163/238 (155 existing + 8 this wave);
next unlocked wave is dependency level 13 (6 concepts):
`phys.mech.hamiltons-equations`, `phys.mod.radioactivity`,
`phys.qm.wave-function`, `phys.rel.lorentz-transform`,
`phys.stat.maxwell-boltzmann`, `phys.stat.partition-function`.

**Concurrent-session reconciliation (2026-07-23, same push)**: while this
Wave 12 batch was in progress, a separate concurrent session pushed
`math.found` Wave 6 (5 concepts: `logical-equivalence`, `ordinal-number`,
`quantifiers`, `relation`, `subset` — already removed from the rows below
by that session's own commit) and a Chemistry Educational Brain batch (24
concepts across `chem.found`/`chem.atomic`/`chem.state`/`chem.thermo`/
`chem.elect`/`chem.surface`/`chem.env`/`chem.period`, levels 0-3) to
`origin/main`. Merging found that the chemistry batch's own commits had
authored all 24 entries but never removed the corresponding 24 rows from
this queue — a bookkeeping gap in that session's work, not this one's;
corrected here as part of this merge (24 chemistry rows removed,
renumbered) rather than left inconsistent. True post-merge total: 227
`READY` (163 physics + 37 mathematics + 24 chemistry + 3 english), 1548
remaining — verified directly against the live `educational-brain/
concepts/{subject}/` directory counts, not estimated.

**Physics Wave 13 (2026-07-23)**: continuing the same mandatory-rules
production cycle, authored all 6 physics concepts at dependency level 13
(the full level, not a partial slice) — `phys.mech.hamiltons-equations`,
`phys.mod.radioactivity`, `phys.qm.wave-function`,
`phys.rel.lorentz-transform`, `phys.stat.maxwell-boltzmann`,
`phys.stat.partition-function` — verified programmatically against the
live physics KG's `requires` edges via an independent Kahn's-algorithm
recomputation (matched the stored level-13 row set exactly, zero
discrepancy), removed from the rows below, and priority numbers
renumbered accordingly (1548 → 1542 remaining). `math.found` remains
untouched at 37/82. Physics EB now 169/238 (163 existing + 6 this wave);
this wave introduced the first Quantum Mechanics domain entry in this
program (`phys.qm.wave-function`) and the second Statistical Mechanics
hub expansion (`phys.stat.maxwell-boltzmann`, `phys.stat.partition-function`).
Next unlocked wave is dependency level 14 (10 concepts):
`phys.mech.poisson-brackets`, `phys.mod.radioactive-decay`,
`phys.qm.schrodinger-equation`, `phys.qm.uncertainty-principle`,
`phys.rel.relativistic-momentum`, `phys.stat.bose-einstein`,
`phys.stat.entropy-statistical`, `phys.stat.fluctuations-correlations`,
`phys.stat.free-energy`, `phys.stat.grand-canonical-ensemble`.

**Concurrent-session reconciliation (2026-07-23, same push)**: this
Wave 13 push encountered a second concurrent Chemistry Educational Brain
batch (8 concepts, level 4: `chem.atomic.bohr-model`, `chem.kinet.rate`,
`chem.sol.types`, `chem.state.molar-mass-gas`, `chem.state.real-gases`,
`chem.thermo.enthalpy`, `chem.thermo.entropy`,
`chem.thermo.heat-capacities`). As with the Wave 12 merge, that
session's commit authored all 8 files but never removed their rows from
this queue (nor added them to `EDUCATIONAL_BRAIN_INDEX.md`/`QUALITY.md`)
— corrected here (8 chemistry rows removed, renumbered: 1542 → 1534).
True post-merge total: 241 `READY` (169 physics + 37 mathematics + 32
chemistry + 3 english), 1534 remaining — verified directly against the
live `educational-brain/concepts/{subject}/` directory counts.

**Physics Wave 14 (2026-07-23)**: continuing the same mandatory-rules
production cycle, authored all 10 physics concepts at dependency level
14 (the full level, not a partial slice) — `phys.mech.poisson-brackets`,
`phys.mod.radioactive-decay`, `phys.qm.schrodinger-equation`,
`phys.qm.uncertainty-principle`, `phys.rel.relativistic-momentum`,
`phys.stat.bose-einstein`, `phys.stat.entropy-statistical`,
`phys.stat.fluctuations-correlations`, `phys.stat.free-energy`,
`phys.stat.grand-canonical-ensemble` — verified programmatically against
the live physics KG's `requires` edges via an independent Kahn's-
algorithm recomputation (matched the stored level-14 row set exactly,
zero discrepancy), removed from the rows below, and priority numbers
renumbered accordingly (1534 → 1524 remaining). `math.found` remains
untouched at 37/82. Physics EB now 179/238 (169 existing + 10 this
wave); this wave completed the Schrödinger-equation hub
(`phys.qm.schrodinger-equation`, unlocking 5 downstream quantum-
mechanics concepts) and the grand-canonical/free-energy hub expansion of
Statistical Mechanics.

**Physics Wave 15 (2026-07-23)**: continuing the same mandatory-rules
production cycle after a read-only forensic repository audit concluded
(no production work that turn), re-fetched `origin/main` (moved twice
during the audit — a concurrent session landed 16 more Chemistry EB
files), authored all 9 physics concepts at dependency level 15 —
`phys.mech.canonical-transformations`, `phys.mod.nuclear-reactions`,
`phys.qm.harmonic-oscillator-qm`, `phys.qm.operators`,
`phys.qm.particle-in-box`, `phys.qm.quantum-tunneling`,
`phys.rel.mass-energy`, `phys.stat.chemical-potential`,
`phys.stat.phase-transitions` — verified programmatically against the
live physics KG's `requires` edges via an independent Kahn's-algorithm
recomputation, removed from the rows below, priority numbers renumbered
accordingly. This same pass also found and corrected 57 stale chemistry
rows left behind by a concurrent session's Chemistry EB batches (level
10-11 authoring landed the files but never removed their queue rows) —
removed and renumbered together with the physics Wave 15 removal in one
pass. Physics EB now 188/238 (179 existing + 9 this wave); this wave
completed all four `phys.qm.schrodinger-equation` hub downstream
concepts (operators, particle-in-box, harmonic oscillator, quantum
tunneling), closed out Statistical Mechanics' two remaining leaf concepts
(chemical potential, phase transitions), and added one Classical
Mechanics capstone (canonical transformations) and one Modern Physics
capstone (nuclear reactions). Next unlocked physics wave (Wave 16) was
NOT computed this batch — recompute fresh from the live KG before
starting, per this program's standing discipline. Total remaining after
both corrections: 1,458 (verified as the exact row count of the table
below).

**Physics Wave 16 (2026-07-23)**: continuing the same mandatory-rules
production cycle immediately after Wave 15 in response to a plain
"Continue" instruction. Re-fetched `origin/main` (0 ahead/0 behind, no
concurrent push this time), re-audited physics EB state fresh (188/238),
authored all 7 physics concepts at dependency level 16 —
`phys.mech.hamilton-jacobi-equation`, `phys.mod.binding-energy`,
`phys.qm.hydrogen-atom-qm`, `phys.qm.spin`, `phys.rel.spacetime`,
`phys.stat.ising-model`, `phys.particle.four-forces` — verified
programmatically against the live physics KG's `requires` edges via an
independent Kahn's-algorithm recomputation, removed from the rows below,
priority numbers renumbered accordingly. `phys.particle.four-forces` is
notable as the verified formal root node of the Particle Physics domain
(its only prerequisites, `phys.em.coulombs-law` and `phys.mod.nuclear-
reactions`, lie outside the domain) — authoring it opens the entire
16-concept Particle Physics domain for future waves. This pass also
discovered and corrected a pre-existing Blueprint-column accuracy bug in
`EDUCATIONAL_BRAIN_INDEX.md`: 21 rows (15 `phys.particle.*` plus 6
`phys.mod.*` semiconductor concepts) had existing Blueprint files on
disk but were recorded as Blueprint="No" — fixed in the same pass;
repo-wide Blueprint-column accuracy re-verified as 0 mismatches in
either direction across the entire file. Physics EB now 195/238
(188 existing + 7 this wave). Next unlocked physics wave (Wave 17) was
NOT computed this batch — recompute fresh from the live KG before
starting. Total remaining after this wave: 1,451 (verified as the exact
row count of the table below).
