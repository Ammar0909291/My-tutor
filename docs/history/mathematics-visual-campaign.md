# Mathematics visual campaign (2026-10-11, owner instruction: "Run one batch of 12 Mathematics visuals first. Show me also every visual.")

Mathematics content work was paused (CLAUDE.md); this batch runs on that explicit fresh instruction. It is a **pilot**: one batch of
12 to measure how much work a batch is, before the owner decides on the rest.

## Why Mathematics, and the measurement behind it

A local audit over all 908 Mathematics KG concepts, calling the real registry functions (`lookupConceptVisualBinding`,
`getConceptSceneGenerator`, `CONCEPT_SCENE_OVERRIDES`; no network, no DB), on main at `4432627a`:

- 47 of 908 concepts (5%) had a fixed figure before this batch.
- By my own tiering (a per-domain rule list written for the audit, spot-checked on 45 random concepts; treat the totals as about ±10%):
  about 346 concepts are ESSENTIAL (their meaning is spatial or graphical), about 210 HELPFUL, about 352 need no figure.
- 45 of the 346 essential concepts were covered; about 301 were not.
- Wrong stock figures were removed on 2026-10-07 (`532055ec`, MATH-010/011/012/025), so most Mathematics lessons now show
  NO figure. That is the safe behaviour; this campaign adds correct ones.

## What this batch adds (new module `sceneGenerators/mathCoreScenesB1.ts`)

Twelve core-level concepts (developing / proficient), six domains, each a figure that draws what the concept's KG
description defines. Numbers are computed, not eyeballed; `mathCoreScenesBatch1.test.ts` re-derives each one.

| Concept | Figure |
|---|---|
| math.geom.pythagorean-theorem | 3-4-5 triangle with a square on each side cut into unit cells: 9 + 16 = 25 |
| math.geom.slope | line through two points, run 3 (red), rise 2 (blue), m = 2/3; a falling line has m < 0 |
| math.geom.parabola | y = x²/4: PF = PD = 3.25 at P, QF = QD = 2 at Q (focus, directrix, vertex) |
| math.geom.circle-equation | circle centre (1, 1), r = 5; legs 4 and 3 give (x − 1)² + (y − 1)² = 25 |
| math.func.graph-of-function | the graph is the set of points (x, f(x)); vertical line test: U passes, circle fails |
| math.func.inverse-functions | f(x) = x³/4 and its mirror image across y = x; (a, b) ↔ (b, a) |
| math.func.domain-range | √(9 − x²): domain −3..3 on the x-axis, range 0..3 on the y-axis |
| math.alg.system-linear-equations | y = x + 1 and y = −½x + 4 cross at (2, 3); parallel = none, same line = infinitely many |
| math.linalg.determinant | unit square becomes a parallelogram of area det = 2·2 − 1·1 = 3 |
| math.linalg.eigenvalues | A = [3 1; 1 3]: v₁ → 4v₁, v₂ → 2v₂ keep direction; an ordinary vector turns |
| math.prob.conditional-probability | 50 outcomes, |B| = 25, |A ∩ B| = 9, so P(A \| B) = 9/25 = 0.36 |
| math.prob.normal-distribution | bell with ±1σ / ±2σ / ±3σ bands: 68.3% / 95.4% / 99.7% (from erf) |

Files: the new module, `mathCoreScenesBatch1.test.ts` (96+ checks), and 13 added lines in `conceptSceneParams.ts` (one import, twelve
registrations next to the existing math entry). Nothing else is touched.

## Two things worth knowing

1. **`math.linalg.vector-addition` is the designated AI canary concept** (`visualCanaryConcept.test.ts`) and must stay figure-less so
   live generation is the only way it can ever produce one. A first draft gave it a figure and broke six canary tests; it was
   replaced in this batch by Equation of a Circle. Do not add a figure for it.
2. Figures are framed with `framed()` (camera pulled in to the same 78% fill target `layout.ts` uses), since these flat 2-D graphs span
   less than the ±5 canvas.

## How each figure was checked

- `resolveVisual` serves each at concept scope, both on an ordinary turn and on "show me a diagram" (the test asserts this).
- Rendered in Chromium through the real renderer (`/dev/physics-audit?concept=…`, which resolves any concept) at 1280 px and 390 px,
  and looked at. Two rounds of layout fixes came out of that: labels the label solver moved away from their object (normal
  distribution brackets, conditional probability, parallel-lines inset), a label detached from its dot (graph of a function,
  circle), and crowded vectors (eigenvectors).
- Not done in this pilot: the full rendered-figure audit with the freshness gate that Physics, Chemistry and Biology have
  (`physicsVisualAudit.test.ts` pattern), light-theme renders, and production verification on the deployed app.

## Pace measurement (the point of the pilot)

One session built the 12 figures, their tests, the renders and this note, including the canary detour. See the owner report for
the session-count estimate this gives.
