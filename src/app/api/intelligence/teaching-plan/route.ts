/**
 * Teaching Plan API — Educational Intelligence Sprint 5, Task 4.
 *
 * GET only: returns the authenticated user's Sprint 4 difficulty `profile`
 * + LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH `difficulties`, the Sprint 4 adaptation `recommendations`,
 * and the new Sprint 5 `teachingPlan`. Read-only — never writes anything,
 * never touches Tutor Max / curriculum / grading / XP. Used only by the
 * dev-only Teaching Plan Viewer (Task 5); no production UI calls it, and
 * nothing consumes the plan this sprint.
