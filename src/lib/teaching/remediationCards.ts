/**
 * REMEDIATION CARDS (Phase H6).
 *
 * ── WHAT A CARD IS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The small, plain account of a concept that a tutor gives when a learner says
 * "I don't understand". Not the reference explanation, not the misconception
 * register, not the teaching plan — the words themselves.
 *
 * Five phases established that the engine around this turn is sound and the
 * AUTHOR is not: the model writes the physics fresh every time, and it can be
 * wrong while being simple, concrete, on-concept and structurally perfect. A
 * card removes the author from the loop for the concepts it covers.
 *
 * ── THE PROMOTION CONTRACT — READ BEFORE CHANGING ANY `status` ──────────────
 * EVERY CARD IN THIS FILE WAS DRAFTED BY AN LLM. All are
 * `authorKind: 'AI_AUTHORED'`, `status: 'DRAFT'`, and NONE of them is
 * authoritative or reachable by a learner.
 *
 * `findRemediationCard` refuses anything that is not ACTIVE **and** authored or
 * signed off by a human. Flipping `status` to 'ACTIVE' while leaving
 * `authorKind: 'AI_AUTHORED'` does NOT make a card servable — that laundering
 * route is closed in code and pinned by test, because a guardrail written by
 * the same kind of system it guards is not a guardrail.
 *
 * TO PROMOTE A CARD, a human must:
 *   1. read the card and satisfy themselves the teaching is correct;
 *   2. set `status: 'ACTIVE'`;
 *   3. set `authorKind: 'AI_AUTHORED_REVIEWED'` (kept the draft's words) or
 *      'HUMAN_CURATOR' (rewrote them), and say so in `provenance`.
 * The act is a reviewed commit, which is a better review surface for prose
 * than an API call: the words being promoted are visible in the diff.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS NOT IN THE DATABASE (audited, not assumed) ──────────────────
 * `AssetIdentity` has exactly the right lifecycle — `authorKind`, `status`,
 * and a working admin promotion endpoint. It was evaluated first and rejected,
 * because the ONLY write path into it available here is the cold-start
 * bootstrap in `src/instrumentation.ts`, which writes
 * `authorKind: HUMAN_CURATOR, status: ACTIVE` for everything in the seed
 * corpus and additionally promotes seed-owned DRAFT rows to ACTIVE unless
 * `DISABLE_SEED_ACTIVATION=true`. Putting AI-drafted cards there would
 * relabel them as human-curated and serve them without any human reading
 * them — the precise outcome this phase's stop rule forbids.
 *
 * ── WHAT THE FIELDS ARE FOR ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   canonicalIdea     the concept in one sentence, for the reviewer
 *   concreteAnchor    the everyday thing the explanation is built on
 *   plainExplanation  THE TEACHING. This is what the learner reads.
 *   antiAnalogy       the tempting comparison that teaches a false mapping.
 *                     NEVER shown to a learner — naming a wrong idea to
 *                     someone who had not thought of it teaches it. It exists
 *                     to constrain a renderer and to be checked by a reviewer.
 *   microCheck        one short question that shows whether the idea landed.
 *                     A comprehension prompt, NOT an assessment: it is not
 *                     graded, it awards no mastery, and it is not an MCQ.
 *
 * Pure data and two pure functions. No model call, no database, no I/O.

    plainExplanation:
      'Push a book across a table and something resists you. That resistance is friction. Two things '
      + 'decide how strong it is: what the two surfaces are made of, and how strongly they are pressed '
      + 'against each other. Now hold the book down with your hand and try again. It is much harder to '
      + 'slide, and the book has not become any heavier. So what matters is not the book\'s weight, it is '

    plainExplanation:
      'Seal a jar half full of water. Water leaves the liquid and water returns to it, and before long '
      + 'those two settle into balance, so the amount of water vapour above stops changing. The push that '

      'A catalyst gives a reaction an easier route so it goes faster, and comes out of the reaction unchanged.',
    concreteAnchor: 'a mountain pass instead of climbing over the summit',
    plainExplanation:
      'A reaction has to get over an energy hill before it can happen. A big hill means the reaction '
      + 'crawls. A catalyst opens a lower pass through the mountain instead of over the top, so far more '
      + 'of the reacting particles have enough energy to get across, and the reaction speeds up. Two '
      + 'things stay exactly the same: where the reaction starts and where it ends, and the catalyst '

    concreteAnchor: 'a shop where people come in and leave at the same rate',
    plainExplanation:
      'Many reactions never finish. Reactants turn into products, and at the same time products turn back '
      + 'into reactants. Think of a shop where people are arriving and leaving at exactly the same rate: '
      + 'the number inside stops changing, although nobody has stopped moving. A reaction reaches that '
      + 'point too, and it is called equilibrium — still running both ways, but nothing you could measure '
      + 'changes any more. At that point, comparing the products against the reactants gives the same '
      + 'number every time, as long as the temperature is the same. That number is the equilibrium '

      'A mechanism is the list of single collisions a reaction really goes through, and the slowest one sets the overall speed.',

    plainExplanation:
      'A balanced equation tells you what goes in and what comes out. It does not tell you how. The real '
      + 'reaction usually happens as a short series of single events — one collision, one bond breaking — '
      + 'and that series is the mechanism. Think of people moving through a building with several doors. '
      + 'One door is narrow and slow. Widening any of the other doors changes nothing; the slow door sets '

    plainExplanation:
      'Stir iron filings into yellow sulfur powder and you can still see both of them, and a magnet drags '
      + 'the iron straight back out. Nothing has joined. You also chose how much of each to put in, and '
      + 'you could have chosen differently. That is a mixture. Now heat the same jar hard. It glows, and '

      + 'any more. The two have joined in a fixed ratio that is not yours to choose, and only another '

      tempting: 'picturing a compound as bricks clicked together that you could pull apart again',

    plainExplanation:
      'A table described as just "two" long tells nobody anything. Two metres is a table; two centimetres '
      + 'is a toy. The number alone carries no information — it only means something once the size being '
      + 'counted is named. That is what a unit is: an agreed size that everyone measures against. '

      + 'it goes further still. The pattern points somewhere: with nothing rubbing at all, it would never '
      + 'stop. So stopping is not what moving things naturally do — stopping is what friction does to '
      + 'them. Left alone, something still stays still and something moving keeps moving at the same '
      + 'speed in the same direction.',
    antiAnalogy: {
      tempting: 'saying that motion needs a continuous force to keep it going',
      whyItFails:

      'Two vectors can be combined in two different ways: one gives a plain number, the other gives a new vector.',

    plainExplanation:
      'Sometimes you want to know how much of one push acts along another direction. Pushing a trolley '
      + 'forwards at an angle, only part of your push moves it along. Combining the two directions that '
      + 'way gives a plain number with no direction of its own. Other times direction is the whole point. '
      + 'Turning a spanner, the force and the handle are both in the flat plane, but the turning happens '
      + 'about an axis pointing out of it. Combining them that way gives a new vector pointing along that '

      + 'you took the stairs or the lift, quickly or slowly. Only where you started and where you ended '
      + 'matter. Gravity is like that, and so is a stretched spring. Friction is not. Drag the bag along '

    plainExplanation:
      'Stir salt into water and you get salt water. Nothing new was made — the salt and the water are '
      + 'both still there, just mixed, and you can boil the water off and get your salt back. How much '
      + 'salt went in was your choice: half as much would still have been salt water, only weaker, and it '
