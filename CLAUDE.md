# My Tutor — Project Memory

## Reporting preference (ALWAYS follow)
- After EVERY prompt/task — including non-coding tasks (audits, Q&A, memory updates) — ALWAYS
  produce a **detailed report** at the end of the turn.
- ALWAYS include **running instructions for the local computer** (install, env setup,
  `npx prisma db push`, `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, type-check) in that report when the task
  touched code; otherwise still close with a report summarizing what was done.
- ALWAYS deliver the report as a **single copy-able block of plain text** (a fenced code block),
  so it can be copied in one action. No exceptions. This means the ENTIRE end-of-turn report —
  not just code/commands inside it — goes inside one ``` fence. Markdown headers/tables/checklists
  outside a fence do NOT satisfy this; wrap the whole thing.

## Architecture facts
- Next.js 14 App Router, NextAuth v5 (JWT), Prisma + PostgreSQL (`db push`, no migration files).
- AI: Groq primary (`openai/gpt-oss-20b`), YandexGPT fallback (Russia only, `country === 'ru'`;
  itself falls back to Groq on missing credentials or any error). Redis optional (app runs without it).
- KnowledgeNode: `{ id, domain, title, description, difficulty, prerequisites[] }`.
  Misconception data is runtime (`MistakeRecord`), NOT in the static KG type.
- Admin gated by `ADMIN_EMAILS` env var (not a DB flag).
- Canonical Knowledge Graph subjects (generic adapter platform, `src/lib/curriculum/knowledgeGraph.ts`
  + `subjectKgAdapter.ts`, one `docs/{subject}/kg/graph.json` + 2 registry lines per subject, no new
  adapter/validator/Teaching Engine code per subject):
  - mathematics → `docs/mathematics/kg/graph.json` (908 concepts, prefix `math.`)
  - physics → `docs/physics/kg/graph.json` (194 concepts, prefix `phys.`)
  - chemistry → `docs/chemistry/kg/graph.json` (187 concepts, prefix `chem.`)
  - computer_science → `docs/computer-science/kg/graph.json` (119 concepts, prefix `cs.`)
  - biology → `docs/biology/kg/graph.json` (89 concepts, prefix `bio.`) — shipped 2026-06-29,
    see `docs/biology/VALIDATION_REPORT.md` for full validator/smoke-test/regression evidence
  - Canonical 10-field schema only: `id, name, requires, unlocks, cross_links, difficulty, bloom,
    mastery_threshold, estimated_hours, description` — never add `domain`/`concept_type` to the
    JSON; they're derived at runtime by `inferDomain()`/`inferConceptType()`.

## Educational Brain — architecture (frozen 2026-06-30, read before any teaching-decision work)
- **Authoritative reference**: `docs/architecture/EDUCATIONAL_BRAIN_V1.md` (+ `ENGINE_REFERENCE.md`,
  `DATA_FLOW.md`, `DEPENDENCY_RULES.md`, `EXTENSION_GUIDE.md`, `ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md`) — the
  full frozen architecture, 65-step chat-route data flow, per-engine contracts, and 15 permanent
  rules. Read this set before changing or extending the Educational Brain; extend it, don't replace it.
- Canonical pipeline core (KG → Student Memory → `src/lib/teaching-engine/index.ts` `decide()` →
  Teaching Action Generator → Dynamic Lesson Composer) runs for **every** chat turn, school or
  general/Library. The `src/lib/school/adaptive/*` cluster splits in two by board/grade coupling
  (see `docs/architecture/ADR_02_GENERAL_LEARNER_DIAGNOSTIC_LAYER.md` for the function-by-function
  evidence): the synthesized 7-type teaching strategy (`teachingStrategy.getTeachingStrategy()`,
  itself folding in mastery, misconception confidence, concept transfer, confidence calibration,
  momentum, and stalemate detection) plus spaced revision now run for **both** school and
  general/Library sessions (`route.ts:294` school branch, `route.ts:964` Library branch, ADR 02,
  implemented 2026-06-30) — board/grade params on those functions are unused plumbing, verified by
  reading bodies. `nextBestAction`/`dailyPlan`/`examReadiness` remain school-only — they genuinely
  walk a board/grade curriculum syllabus tree with no Library equivalent. `lessonPlanner.buildLessonPlan()`
  also now runs for both (`route.ts` ~1019, ADR 02 §7 follow-up #1, implemented 2026-06-30) — it only
  reads `.id`/`.title` off each node, so a `CurriculumNode` satisfies it with a trivial inline mapping.
  `prerequisiteRecovery.detectPrerequisiteGap` remains school-only and is NOT a simple shape-reconciliation
  case: it resolves prerequisite ids through a module-global `KG_BY_ID` keyed on the canonical school KG
  only, which a Library subject's node slugs can never match — wiring it needs a signature change
  (caller-supplied corpus map) that touches the live school call site too, deferred (ADR 02 §7 item 1).
- One system is **archived/dormant, never executes against live traffic** — do not extend it
  expecting production effect: `src/lib/educationalBrain/*` (Eb* pipeline, fire-and-forget, gated
  by `ENABLE_EDUCATIONAL_BRAIN_PIPELINE`, default off, carries an archive-status header comment).
  `src/lib/curriculum/teachingActionEngine.ts` (a duplicate, zero-caller "HOW to teach" decision
  engine, confusingly similar to the live `src/lib/teaching-engine/index.ts`) was confirmed
  genuinely dead and **deleted 2026-06-30** — see `docs/architecture/ADR_03_RETIRE_ORPHANED_TEACHING_ACTION_ENGINE.md`.
  Its Teaching Assets Platform siblings (`teachingAssetSchema.ts`/`teachingAssetAdapter.ts`/
  `teachingAssets.ts`, real curriculum content for all 5 subjects) remain — still zero live
  importers, left untouched as an explicit open question, not this session's to decide.
- `src/lib/school/adaptive/nextBestAction.ts` is a split file: its namesake `getNextBestAction()`
  (5-tier engine), `nextActionHref()`, and its own `NEXT_ACTION_LABELS` export are confirmed
  zero-caller dead code (their one plausible consumer, `src/components/dashboard/SchoolDashboard.tsx`,
  is itself a confirmed-orphaned, unrendered component — the live `/dashboard` route renders
  `DashboardV2` instead, which sources recommendations via `learningOrchestrator.ts`). The file's
  fourth export, `getChapterNextStep()`, remains genuinely live (`route.ts`, the chapter workspace
  page) and must not be touched. A surgical-removal **proposal** (not executed, and per explicit
  user instruction will **stay unexecuted indefinitely** — documentation-only is the final state)
  is written up in `docs/architecture/ADR_04_NEXT_BEST_ACTION_RETIREMENT_PROPOSAL.md`.
- **Priority pivot (2026-06-30):** dead-code/duplication auditing (the ADR 03/04 pattern) is
  deprioritized. Current priority is forward-looking Educational Brain system design: Knowledge
  Graph consumption, Teaching Action Intelligence, Student Memory evolution, Dynamic Lesson
  Composition, Evidence Engine, Recommendation Intelligence, Mastery Engine, Visualization
  selection, Simulation architecture, Assessment architecture, Beginner→Intermediate→Expert
  progression, entrance examination framework, curriculum mapping architecture, AI independence
  strategy, long-term scalability. Don't propose/execute further cleanup unless it blocks one of
  these. First finding under this pivot: two of the canonical KG's 10 authored fields
  (`cross_links`, `mastery_threshold`) are parsed by `subjectKgAdapter.ts` but never exposed past
  it — neither `ConceptNode` nor `KnowledgeNode` carries them, and `mastery_threshold` (which
  varies 0.35–0.95 across mathematics's 908 concepts) has zero runtime effect because every
  scoring engine reads the flat `ASSESSMENT_PASS_THRESHOLD = 70` constant instead. 3-phase
  resolution **proposed, not executed** in
  `docs/architecture/ADR_05_KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_CONSUMPTION_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Full evidence, governance rule, and a corrected map of what's live vs. dormant:
  `docs/EDUCATIONAL_BRAIN_CONSOLIDATION.md`. **Governance rule**: before starting any new "decide
  what to teach / what strategy / what mastery state" system, re-fetch the remote tip, read the
  architecture freeze above, grep `src/lib/teaching-engine/`, `src/lib/school/adaptive/`, and
  `src/app/api/learn/chat/route.ts`, and explain why extending the canonical pipeline in place is
  insufficient. A new parallel pipeline is not an acceptable answer to "the existing one feels
  architecturally rough" — refactor the live system instead.
